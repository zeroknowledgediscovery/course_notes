### PLANNED ASSESSMENTS

Assignments will generally require modeling problems in R or Python. There will be occasional homeworks, one mid-term as- signment, and one final project. The mid-term will be a Kaggle In-Class Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/about/inclass/overview). Final assessment will depend on the performance on the assignments.
