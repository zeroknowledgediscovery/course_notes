# Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics for Biomedicine 

## CCTS40500

---

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Easy availability of data is rapidly transforming scientific research, and advanced analytics powered by sophisticated learning
algorithms is uncovering new insights in complex open problems in biology and biomedicine. The goal of this course is to
provide an introductory overview of the key concepts in machine learning, outlining the potential applications in biomedicine.
Beginning from basic statistical concepts, we will discuss concepts and implementations of standard and state of the art
classification and prediction algorithms, and go on to discuss more advanced topics in unsupervised learning, deep learning
architectures, and stochastic time series analysis. We will also cover emerging ideas in data-driven causal inference, and
demonstrate applications in uncovering etiological insights from large scale clinical databases of electronic health records,
and publicly available sequence and omics datasets.

## LEARNING GOALS

The acquisition of hands-on skills will be emphasized over machine learning theory. On successfully completing the course,
students will have acquired enough knowledge of the underlying machinery to intuit and implement solutions to non-trivial
data science problems arising in biology and medicine. Rudimentary knowledge of probability theory, and basic exposure to
scripting languages such as python/R is required.
