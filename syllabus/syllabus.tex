\section*{Course Description}

Easy accessibility to data is rapidly transforming scientific research, and advanced analytics powered by sophisticated 
learning algorithms  is uncovering new insights, and solutions to hard problems.  The goal of this course  is to provide an introductory overview of the key concepts in machine learning, outlining the potential applications in biomedicine and sociology. Beginning from basic statistical concepts, we will discuss  implementations of standard and state of the art classification and prediction algorithms, and go on to discuss  more advanced topics in unsupervised learning, deep learning architectures, and stochastic time series analysis. We will also cover emerging ideas in data-driven causal inference, and demonstrate applications in uncovering etiological insights from large scale datasets including clinical databases of electronic health records, publicly available sequence and  omics datasets in biology, and large scale geospatial datasets in sociology.

\section*{Learning Goals}

The  acquisition of hands-on skills will be emphasized over machine learning theory. On successfully completing the course, students will   have acquired enough knowledge of the underlying machinery to intuit and implement solutions to  non-trivial data science problems. Rudimentary knowledge of probability theory, and basic exposure to scripting languages such as python is required. 

\section*{Planned Assessments}
Students will be required to turn in solutions to take-home modeling problems, with scripted software in Python.
There will be one mid-term assignment, and one final assignment/project. Homework problems will be assigned regularly but not weekly. Final assessment will depend on the performanace on  the assignments and the homework problems, and the level of engagement and interest perceived by the instructor.

% \section*{Instructor Bio}
% Ishanu Chattopadhyay has a diverse background in machine learning, automated decision-making, stochastic processes and systems biology. He has multiple graduate degrees in engineering, computer science, and mathematics. He earned his doctoral degree from the Pennsylvania State University, and completed his postdoctoral training from Cornell University. As a faculty in the Department of Medicine, Chattopadhyay heads the laboratory for Zero Knowledge Discovery (\href{zed.uchicago.edu}{zed.uchicago.edu}) , where his research focuses on the theory of unsupervised machine learning, and data-driven causal inference in biomedicine. His work has resulted in new  algorithms for pattern discovery in vast structured and unstructured datasets, to gain new insights in data intensive problems arising in biology and biomedicine. Chattopadhyayâ€™s current research interests include 1) the application of deep learning tools to electronic health record databases with the objective of distilling actionable etiological insights into comorbidities of complex diseases, and 2) (predictive ML-augmented biosurveillance) analysis of viral sequence databases to identify emergent patterns that signal impending pandemics, as a part of DARPA's PREEMPT program (https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-01-04) .  Research assistants will have exposure to cutting-edge data science and machine learning methods, and will have the opportunity to apply next generation learning algorithms to investigate etiologies of complex diseases at the molecular and population levels, and translate inferred analytics to clinical decision-making. Assistants are expected to have a basic understanding of statistical models, and previous experience in python scripting.
